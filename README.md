# NASA's Daily Photo

This project is designed to simulate a code challenge provided by an employer. It is designed to be developed in a JavaScript framework that I have little experience with (in this case Vue.js) and completed in under 48 hours. The goal of this project is to consume the NASA API at the endpoint specifically that provides the image of the day. The user should be able to dynamically select a photo based on any given date (as long as its not in the future of course). Check out the deployed app [here](https://nasa-photo.herokuapp.com/).
