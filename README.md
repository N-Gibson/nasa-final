# nasa-final

This project is designed to simulate a code challenge provided by an employer. It is designed to be developed in a JS framework that I have little experience in (Vue.js). The goal of this project is to consume the NASA API at the endpoint specifically that provides the image of the day. The user is supposed to be able to select a photo be specifying a date in the past.
